1 - point the simulate, if object is big then probablity of simulated on corners is not good, so there must be wrong assigning of label , it refine the wrongly labeled , so bigger size will mostly close to center the pointm or start bbix from the point 


suggests hyperparameters and diagnostics.

You can drop this into your SAM / segmentation pseudo-label pipeline and tune thresholds on a tiny held-out set.

Determine size class by deterministic thresholds:

medium if

small otherwise

For each region, build a deterministic center mask:

large → use central crop (e.g., central 50–70% of 
R
R or image) as only allowed prompt region

medium → central 70–90% allowed

small → allow whole region (or small dilation)

Score masks deterministically by combining average confidence with whether mask overlaps the allowed prompt region sufficiently. Accept pseudo-label if score > threshold.

Concrete deterministic rules & recommended defaults

Entropy threshold 
Te
T
e
	​

: choose relative value (e.g., percentile). Recommended: use entropy < 0.45–0.6 (if entropy normalized to [0,1]) or use the 10–20th percentile of all entropies in that image.

Size thresholds:

Slarge=0.10
S
large
	​

=0.10 (object covers ≥10% of image area → large)

Smid=0.02
S
mid
	​

=0.02 (object covers 2–10% → medium)

Allowed central fraction per size:

large → keep central fraction 
fc=0.5
f
c
	​

=0.5 (only center half)

medium → 
fc=0.7
f
c
	​

=0.7

small → 
fc=1.0
f
c
	​

=1.0 (anywhere within region)

Overlap requirement to accept mask: at least 
poverlap=0.5
p
overlap
	​

=0.5 of mask area must intersect with allowed central region.

Combined score:

score=wconf⋅avg_conf(M)+wcenter⋅1[overlap≥poverlap]
score=w

These are deterministic and interpretable — tweak as needed.

🔹 Intuition:

Measures how far along both axes a point is from the center.

Both 
dx
d
x
	​

 and 
dy
d
y
	​

 must be large (near edges/corners) to give a high score.

If the point lies near the center, one or both of them are small, so 
S
S becomes small.

The optional exponent 
γ
γ controls contrast (e.g., 
γ=0.5
γ=0.5 gives smoother rise).

🔹 Model Type (in conceptual terms):

You can think of it as a multiplicative geometric proximity model —
essentially a normalized bilinear measure of distance from the center.

In spatial modeling terms:

It’s nonlinear (because of the product).

It models “cornerness” as joint distance from the midlines of the rectangle.




🔍 The core idea you just described

“If the object is big and the true label point is in a corner, but the prediction mask doesn’t include it → the distance from the labeled point to the predicted region is large → the model is definitely wrong.”

That distance is a strong self-supervised signal:
it tells you how inconsistent the model’s mask is with known geometric priors.

🧠 Step 1: Quantify the “error geometry”

Let:

p=(xp,yp)
p=(x
p
	​

,y
p
	​

): the known point (maybe weak supervision or pseudo label)

Mpred(x,y)
M
pred
	​

(x,y): predicted mask (0/1 or probability)

B
B: bounding box or region of the object (width 
w
w, height 
h
h)

S(x,y)
S(x,y): your edge/corner prior (close to 1 at corners)

Then compute:

D=min⁡(x,y):Mpred(x,y)=1(x−xp)2+(y−yp)2
D=
(x,y):M
